## Hi there! 👋

Hey, I'm Jasmin, your local agender chaos goblin from Germany. My pronouns are _they/them_, but you can
also use _sie/ihr_ if you're referencing me in German.

- 👩‍💻 Working on several software projects, written in Go, JavaScript/TypeScript and (unfortunately, but only at work) Java.
- 🤖 If it can be automated, I want to automate it.
- ♿ I'm focusing on creating accessible user interfaces and accessibility in general.
- 👀 Right now, I'm learning stuff about DevOps strategies and so on.

### 📫 How to reach me

I'd prefer communication with Matrix, I'm available as @jasmin:catgirl.cloud there.
If we already know each other, we can also use Signal.

<small>no, I'm actually not a catgirl. It's just an escalated meme.</small>
